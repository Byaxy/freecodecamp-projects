            <h2>Early Life and Career</h2>
            <p>
              Born and raised in Jinja District of Busoga Sub region, Moses
              Radio attended Kibuye Primary school in Makindye and later, Holy
              Cross Lake View Jinja for his O'level and later Kiira College
              Butiki for A'level before joining Makerere University where he
              graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Community Sociology in 2005.
              Radio released his first solo song, "Tujja Kuba Wamu" in 2004
              while at Makerere University where he completed a degree in
              psychology, before joining the Leone Island Music Empire in 2005.
              He started as a backup singer along with Weasel behind Jose
              Chameleone. He had first success in the year 2005 after he had
              released a reggae love song called "Jennifer", the official stage
              video for that song was filmed by Ugandan music promoter DJ
              Erycom.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2006, Mowzey Radio released another song titled "Sweet Lady",
              another well received song that introduced him to a large fan base
              in Uganda. In October 2007, Mowzey Radio, Weasel and Jose
              Chameleone toured the United States and the Caribbean. Before they
              returned home, Radio and Weasel had misunderstandings with Jose
              Chameleone. Following disagreements between Jose Chameleone and
              the two, they quit the group and formed Goodlyfe Crew, who became
              successful. Their first song was "Nakudata", followed by "Ngamba"
              and others. He made music collaborations with musicians such as
              Rabadaba in the song "Ability" together with Weasel, produced by
              Just Jose.

              In his singing career he did collaborations with both local and
              international artists winning awards and several nominations
              including the BET nominations.Radio and Weasel had many hits,
              including: "Ability", "Akapapula", "Bread and Butter", "Hellenah"
              ft David Lutalo, "Juice Juicy", "Lwaki Onnumya", "Magnetic", "Mr
              DJ", "Mukama Talya Mandazi", "Ngenda Maaso", "Nyambula",
              "Nyumbani", "Obudde", "Potential", "Sitaani", "Zuena", and
              "(Tukikole) Neera", which played incessantly on most radio and TV
